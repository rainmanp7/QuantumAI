My Scattered research work of creating
Quatum Learning Artificial intelligence
````
I put this here so anyone can learn from
my research work. Especially Artificial intelligence
that I could help make smarter and self learning.

just remember my name: rainmanp7
maybe you will use my work and create something amazing.
this work was done many years ago but it's now Online
from I would have to guess 19 years ago originally dealing with
math matic formulas from another project. I put that together
with Artificial intelligence Reinforcement learning and formulated
a new species,capable of learning in different spectrums of thought.
"Enahanced Neural Synaptic Learning"
