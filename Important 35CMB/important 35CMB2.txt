The whole equation using memoization and detailed information:

Python
def calculate_weight_update(wi0, dij, τ, learning_method_coefficients, complexity_factor, object_properties, position_relative_to_center): """Calculates the weight update for object 'i'.
Args: wi0: The initial baseline weight for object 'i'. dij: The distance between objects 'i' and 'j'. τ: The parameter that controls the strength of the distance effect. learning_method_coefficients: A dictionary of coefficients that map from learning methods to their influence on the weight update. complexity_factor: A factor that scales the impact of various factors based on the complexity of the problem. object_properties: A dictionary of properties for object 'i' (position, orientation, distance from center). position_relative_to_center: A dictionary of coordinates that serve as a reference point for calculating relative positions.
Returns: The updated weight for object 'i'. """
Calculate the distance factor.
distance_factor = 1 / (1 + (dij / τ))
Calculate the learning method factor.
learning_method_factor = sum([ learning_method_coefficients[learning_method] * object_properties[learning_method] for learning_method in learning_method_coefficients ])
Calculate the complexity factor.
complexity_factor = complexity_factor * sum([ object_properties[property] * object_properties[property] for property in object_properties ])
Calculate the weight update.
weight_update = (wi0 * distance_factor) * (1 + learning_method_factor + complexity_factor)
Memoize the result.
if (wi0, dij, τ, learning_method_coefficients, complexity_factor, object_properties, position_relative_to_center) not in _cache: _cache[(wi0, dij, τ, learning_method_coefficients, complexity_factor, object_properties, position_relative_to_center)] = weight_update
return _cache[(wi0, dij, τ, learning_method_coefficients, complexity_factor, object_properties, position_relative_to_center)]
Initialize the cache.
_cache = {}

This equation is a modified version of the equation that we discussed earlier. The main difference is that this equation uses memoization to speed up the calculation of the weight update.
The memoization technique is used to store the results of the calculation in a cache. This means that the calculation only needs to be performed once, and the results can be reused later. This can significantly speed up the calculation of the equation, especially when the same values are used multiple times.
I hope this is helpful! Let me know if you have any other questions.

Here is the equation itself with the modifications in place:

Python
def calculate_weight_update(wi0, dij, τ, learning_method_coefficients, complexity_factor, object_properties, position_relative_to_center):
  """Calculates the weight update for object 'i'.

  Args:
    wi0: The initial baseline weight for object 'i'.
    dij: The distance between objects 'i' and 'j'.
    τ: The parameter that controls the strength of the distance effect.
    learning_method_coefficients: A dictionary of coefficients that map from learning methods to their influence on the weight update.
    complexity_factor: A factor that scales the impact of various factors based on the complexity of the problem.
    object_properties: A dictionary of properties for object 'i' (position, orientation, distance from center).
    position_relative_to_center: A dictionary of coordinates that serve as a reference point for calculating relative positions.

  Returns:

  """

  # Calculate the distance factor.
  distance_factor = 1 / (1 + (dij / τ))

  # Calculate the learning method factor.
  learning_method_factor = sum([
      learning_method_coefficients[learning_method] * object_properties[learning_method]
      for learning_method in learning_method_coefficients
  ])

  # Calculate the complexity factor.
  complexity_factor = complexity_factor * sum([
      object_properties[property] * object_properties[property]
      for property in object_properties
  ])

  # Calculate the weight update.
  weight_update = (wi0 * distance_factor) * (1 + learning_method_factor + complexity_factor)

  # Memoize the result.
  if (wi0, dij, τ, learning_method_coefficients, complexity_factor, object_properties, position_relative_to_center) not in _cache:
    _cache[(wi0, dij, τ, learning_method_coefficients, complexity_factor, object_properties, position_relative_to_center)] = weight_update

  return _cache[(wi0, dij, τ, learning_method_coefficients, complexity_factor, object_properties, position_relative_to_center)]

# Initialize the cache.
_cache = {}

This is the same equation as before, but with the memoization code added. The memoization code is surrounded by the if statement. The if statement checks to see if the calculation has been performed before. If it has, the result is retrieved from the cache. If it hasn't, the calculation is performed and the result is stored in the cache.
This memoization code can significantly speed up the calculation of the equation, especially when the same values are used multiple times.
