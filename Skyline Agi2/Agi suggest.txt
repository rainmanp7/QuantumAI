Achieving AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) with cognitive behavior that improves over time is a complex and challenging goal. While there's no guaranteed recipe for achieving AGI, here are some strategies and considerations that could help your streamlined version move towards AGI-like cognitive behavior:

1. **Reinforcement Learning:** Implement a reinforcement learning framework that allows your system to learn from its interactions with its environment. Over time, the system can adjust its behavior based on feedback and rewards, gradually improving its decision-making.

2. **Adaptive Learning:** Your system can adapt its learning rate based on its performance and the difficulty of the tasks it encounters. Implement algorithms that allow your system to automatically adjust its learning parameters to optimize its learning process.

3. **Transfer Learning:** Incorporate transfer learning techniques to enable your system to leverage knowledge gained from one task to improve its performance on another task. This can help your system acquire new skills more efficiently.

4. **Meta-Learning:** Implement meta-learning strategies where your system learns how to learn. By training your system on a variety of tasks, it can develop more general learning algorithms that facilitate faster learning on new tasks.

5. **Evolutionary Algorithms:** Explore evolutionary algorithms that simulate natural selection to improve the performance of your system. Over time, the system can evolve and adapt to changing environments and tasks.

6. **Continuous Learning:** Allow your system to continuously learn from new data and experiences. Implement mechanisms that prevent catastrophic forgetting, ensuring that previously learned knowledge is retained while new knowledge is acquired.

7. **Curriculum Learning:** Design a curriculum of tasks that gradually increase in complexity. This scaffolding approach can help your system learn foundational concepts before tackling more advanced ones.

8. **Neuroevolution:** Consider using neuroevolution techniques to evolve neural network architectures and parameters. This can help your system discover more effective ways of processing information.

9. **Ensemble Learning:** Combine multiple learning methods or models to create an ensemble. This can lead to improved performance by leveraging the strengths of different approaches.

10. **Human Feedback:** Incorporate human feedback to guide the learning process. Humans can provide valuable insights and correct mistakes, accelerating the system's learning curve.

11. **Self-Assessment:** Implement mechanisms that allow your system to assess its own performance and identify areas for improvement. This can lead to more targeted learning strategies.

12. **Exploration vs. Exploitation:** Balance exploration of new strategies with exploitation of known successful strategies. This balance is crucial for discovering new methods while also making use of what's already working.

Remember that achieving AGI-like behavior is a long-term goal and involves a multidisciplinary approach, combining advances in machine learning, cognitive science, neuroscience, and more. It's important to continually research, experiment, and iterate to make progress towards AGI while ensuring ethical considerations and safety precautions are taken into account.
