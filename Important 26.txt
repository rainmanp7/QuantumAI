The equation that I am using:

wi = (wi0 / (1 + (dij / τ))) * (1 + α * Ps + β * T + γ * M + δ * V + ε * MA + ζ * C + η * S + θ
* Si + complexity_factor * (w_x * x_i + w_y * y_i + w_z * z_i + w_O * O_i + w_D * D_i +
w_cx * (x_i - x_c) + w_cy * (y_i - y_c) + w_cz * (z_i - z_c)))

This equation is a modified version of the equation that was described by rainmanp7.
The new equation incorporates the complexity factor, which dynamically adjusts the
weights based on the problem's complexity. This allows the learning process to focus
on the most relevant factors and explore the solution space more effectively.
The equation has the following parameters:
● wi: The updated weight or value of object i after incorporating all the factors.
● wi0: The initial weight or value of object i before considering any factors. This
acts as a baseline or starting point.
● dij: The distance between object i and another object j in the environment.
● τ: A parameter controlling the strength of the distance effect on the weight
update. Larger values make the distance effect weaker, and smaller values
make it stronger.
● Ps: The effectiveness of positive self-talk for the current state i. It influences how
positive self-talk impacts the weight update for object i.
● T: The linear timeline component representing the progression of learning for the
current state i. It accounts for the learning progress of object i over time.
● α, β, γ, δ, ε, ζ, η, θ: Parameters controlling the influence of different aspects on
the weight update. These factors include:
○ α: Controls the impact of positive self-talk (Ps) on the weight update.
○ β: Controls the impact of the timeline component (T) on the weight
update.
○ γ: Controls the impact of mnemonics effectiveness (M) on the weight
update.
○ δ: Controls the impact of visual cues involvement (V) on the weight
update.
○ ε: Controls the impact of multi-sensory approach incorporation (MA) on
the weight update.
○ ζ: Controls the impact of keeping concepts concrete (C) on the weight
update.
○ η: Controls the impact of utilizing similarities more familiar (S) to achieve
the goal on the weight update.
○ θ: Controls the impact of example solutions provided (Si) for the current
state i on the weight update.
● complexity_factor: A factor that represents the complexity of the problem. It
scales the influence of the weights on the learning process based on the
problem's complexity. Higher complexity factors indicate more complex problems
and will lead to more significant weight adjustments.
● w_x, w_y, w_z, w_O, w_D, w_cx, w_cy, w_cz: Weights that control the influence
of the x, y, and z coordinates of objects (x_i, y_i, z_i), the orientation (O_i), and
the outer lying distance (D_i) in the learning process. These weights are
automatically adjusted based on the complexity_factor, allowing the learning
process to adapt its focus based on the problem's complexity.
● x_i, y_i, z_i: The x, y, and z coordinates of object i, representing its position in 3D
space.
● O_i: The orientation of object i, which indicates its self-centered aspect.
● D_i: The outer lying distance of object i from the learning process's current
position, representing its distance from the central position.
● x_c, y_c, z_c: The x, y, and z coordinates of the center position. This represents
the main objective or the central point that the learning process aims to achieve.
