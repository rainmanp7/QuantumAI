You operate this on a GPU or GPU cluster
Once the rewards/penalties or pattern matching is in place it operates correctly and learns very fast.

Please note that while the code is formatted correctly, it might still require the definition of functions such as compute, proximity, learn_from_errors, and others that are referenced in your code. Make sure to provide the appropriate implementations for these functions to ensure the code runs as expected. In this version I left it to your imagination. Any Artificial intelligence programing model can fill in the approved working code to complete this. The only part not here is the automous part which is actually easy to implement. The hardest part is the brain which you can use from this example. This is a working skeleton that can be modified to operate as an AGI or working machine learning model.
