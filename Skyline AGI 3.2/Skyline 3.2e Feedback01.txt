For a simple and code-efficient approach, you can implement a basic feedback loop using a few lines of code. Here's a simplified example in Python:

```python
# Define initial complexity factor
dynamic_complexity_factor = initial_value

# Training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    # Train the model on your data
    
    # Evaluate model performance
    current_metrics = evaluate_model()

    # Update dynamic complexity factor based on metrics
    dynamic_complexity_factor = update_complexity_factor(dynamic_complexity_factor, current_metrics)

# After training loop, use the final dynamic complexity factor for adjustments
```

In this example:
- `evaluate_model()` is a function that calculates relevant metrics based on the model's performance.
- `update_complexity_factor()` is a function that adjusts the dynamic complexity factor based on the evaluation metrics.

This simple loop allows you to continuously update the complexity factor during training, with minimal code. Depending on your specific use case, you may need to customize the `evaluate_model()` and `update_complexity_factor()` functions to suit your requirements.
