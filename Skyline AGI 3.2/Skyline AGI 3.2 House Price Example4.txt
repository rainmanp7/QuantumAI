Skyline AGI 3.2 model is used to solve a regression problem. In this case, we'll use the model to predict the price of a house based on its features.
 
Inputs:
 
- "wi0": [2000, 4, 3, 0.25, 0] (These are the features of the house, including the year of construction, number of bedrooms, number of bathrooms, lot size in acres, and whether it has a pool or not.)

- "vector_dij": [350000] (This represents the target variable, which is the price of the house.)
 
Weights and Biases:
 
- "α": 0.8

- "β": 0.5

- "γ": 0.6

- "δ": 0.3

- "ε": 0.2

- "ζ": 0.4

- "η": 0.7

- "θ": 0.9

- "φ": 0.1
 
Activation Functions:
 
- "Ps": "relu"

- "T": "sigmoid"

- "M": "tanh"

- "V": "softmax"

- "MA": "relu"

- "C": "sigmoid"

- "Rr": "tanh"

- "Cr": "softmax"

- "Lr": "relu"
 
Complexity Factor:
 
- "complexity_factor": 3
 
Now, let's calculate the predicted price of the house using the Skyline AGI 3.2 model:
 
1. Weighted Sum Calculation:
 
- "wi0" = [2000, 4, 3, 0.25, 0]

- "weights_and_biases" = ["α", "β", "γ", "δ", "ε", "ζ", "η", "θ", "φ"]

- Calculate the weighted sum by multiplying each input element by the corresponding weight and adding the biases:
- weighted_sum = [2000 * 0.8 + 4 * 0.5 + 3 * 0.6 + 0.25 * 0.3 + 0 * 0.2] = [1610.95]

2. Activation Function Application:
 
- "activation_functions" = ["Ps", "T", "M", "V", "MA", "C", "Rr", "Cr", "Lr"]

- Apply each activation function to the weighted sum:
- activated_weighted_sum = [relu(1610.95), sigmoid(1610.95), tanh(1610.95), softmax(1610.95)] = [1610.95, 1, 1, 1]

3. Output Calculation:
 
- Multiply the activated weighted sum by the complexity factor:
- output = [1610.95, 1, 1, 1] * 3 = [4832.85, 3, 3, 3]
 
Based on this calculation, the predicted price of the house using the Skyline AGI 3.2 model is approximately $4,832.85.
 
Please note that this is a simplified example, and in real-world scenarios, training the model on a larger dataset with appropriate algorithms and evaluation techniques would be necessary to achieve accurate predictions.
