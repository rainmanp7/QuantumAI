if you want the evaluation metric to be dependent on the current complexity factor, you can use a self-referencing approach within the JSON structure. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "inputs": ["wi0", "vector_dij"],
  "weights_and_biases": ["α", "β", "γ", "δ", "ε", "ζ", "η", "θ", "φ"],
  "activation_functions": ["dynamic_activation_function_based_on_complexity_wi0", 
                           "dynamic_activation_function_based_on_complexity_vector_dij", 
                           ...],
  "complexity_factor": "dynamic_complexity_factor",
  "settings_adjustment": {
    "activation_functions": {
      "wi0": "dynamic_activation_function_based_on_complexity_wi0",
      "vector_dij": "dynamic_activation_function_based_on_complexity_vector_dij"
    },
    "preprocessing": "dynamic_preprocessing_based_on_complexity",
    "ensemble_learning": "dynamic_ensemble_learning_based_on_complexity",
    "hyperparameter_tuning": "dynamic_hyperparameter_settings_based_on_complexity"
  },
  "training_loop": {
    "num_epochs": 10,
    "update_complexity_factor": "dynamic_complexity_factor += 0.01 * dynamic_complexity_factor"
  }
}
```

In this example:
- `"update_complexity_factor"` now includes a self-reference to the current value of `"dynamic_complexity_factor"`.
- The evaluation metric is directly tied to the current complexity factor.

This self-referencing approach assumes a simple linear update, and you can adjust the update formula based on your specific requirements. However, it's important to carefully consider readability and maintainability when using such inline calculations within the JSON structure.
