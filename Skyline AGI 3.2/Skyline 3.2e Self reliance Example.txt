if you want the rate of change for the complexity factor to be dependent on the current value of the complexity factor itself, you can express this in a more dynamic way within the JSON structure. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "inputs": ["wi0", "vector_dij"],
  "weights_and_biases": ["α", "β", "γ", "δ", "ε", "ζ", "η", "θ", "φ"],
  "activation_functions": ["dynamic_activation_function_based_on_complexity_wi0", 
                           "dynamic_activation_function_based_on_complexity_vector_dij", 
                           ...],
  "complexity_factor": "dynamic_complexity_factor",
  "settings_adjustment": {
    "activation_functions": {
      "wi0": "dynamic_activation_function_based_on_complexity_wi0",
      "vector_dij": "dynamic_activation_function_based_on_complexity_vector_dij"
    },
    "preprocessing": "dynamic_preprocessing_based_on_complexity",
    "ensemble_learning": "dynamic_ensemble_learning_based_on_complexity",
    "hyperparameter_tuning": "dynamic_hyperparameter_settings_based_on_complexity"
  },
  "training_loop": {
    "num_epochs": 10,
    "update_complexity_factor": "dynamic_complexity_factor *= 1 + 0.01 * dynamic_complexity_factor"
  }
}
```

In this example:
- `"update_complexity_factor"` includes a self-reference to the current value of `"dynamic_complexity_factor"` in the rate of change calculation.

This way, the rate of change becomes proportional to the current complexity factor, providing a more dynamic update mechanism directly within the JSON structure. Adjust the formula based on your specific needs and considerations.
