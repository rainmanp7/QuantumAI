In this example, the equation has four main components:

* "inputs": This key represents the input vectors for the model. The value for this key is a list of two input vectors, "wi0" and "vector_dij".
* "weights_and_biases": This key represents the weights and biases of the model. The value for this key is a list of nine weights and biases, "α", "β", "γ", "δ", "ε", "ζ", "η", "θ", and "φ".
* "activation_functions": This key represents the activation functions used in the model. The value for this key is a list of nine activation functions, "Ps", "T", "M", "V", "MA", "C", "Rr", "Cr", and "Lr".
* "complexity_factor": This key represents the complexity factor of the model. The value for this key is a single value, "complexity_factor".
