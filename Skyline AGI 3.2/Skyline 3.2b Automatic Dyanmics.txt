A more automated and self-adjusting system where the model looks at the complexity factor and dynamically adjusts settings without explicit conditional code. While this approach can enhance adaptability, it's crucial to design the system carefully. Here's a conceptual way to structure it:

```json
{
  "inputs": [
    "wi0",
    "vector_dij"
  ],
  "weights_and_biases": [
    "α", "β", "γ", "δ", "ε", "ζ", "η", "θ", "φ"
  ],
  "activation_functions": [
    "dynamic_activation_function_based_on_complexity_wi0", "dynamic_activation_function_based_on_complexity_vector_dij", ...
  ],
  "complexity_factor": "dynamic_complexity_factor",
  "settings_adjustment": {
    "activation_functions": {
      "wi0": "dynamic_activation_function_based_on_complexity_wi0",
      "vector_dij": "dynamic_activation_function_based_on_complexity_vector_dij"
    },
    "preprocessing": "dynamic_preprocessing_based_on_complexity",
    "ensemble_learning": "dynamic_ensemble_learning_based_on_complexity",
    "hyperparameter_tuning": "dynamic_hyperparameter_settings_based_on_complexity"
  }
}
```

Now, the actual adjustment logic can be generalized and implemented in a loop or function:

```python
# Pseudocode for dynamic adjustments based on complexity factor
complexity_factor = get_dynamic_complexity_factor()

# Adjust activation functions dynamically
for input_name, dynamic_function in settings_adjustment["activation_functions"].items():
    activation_function = dynamic_function(complexity_factor)
    set_activation_function(input_name, activation_function)

# Adjust preprocessing dynamically
preprocessing_techniques = settings_adjustment["preprocessing"](complexity_factor)
set_preprocessing_techniques(preprocessing_techniques)

# Adjust ensemble learning dynamically
ensemble_strategy = settings_adjustment["ensemble_learning"](complexity_factor)
set_ensemble_strategy(ensemble_strategy)

# Adjust hyperparameter settings dynamically
hyperparameter_settings = settings_adjustment["hyperparameter_tuning"](complexity_factor)
set_hyperparameter_settings(hyperparameter_settings)
```

This way, the loop or function iterates through the specified settings, and each setting has its own dynamic adjustment function based on the complexity factor. It provides a more modular and scalable way to handle dynamic adjustments. Ensure that the dynamic adjustment functions are designed to gracefully handle various complexity factor values.
