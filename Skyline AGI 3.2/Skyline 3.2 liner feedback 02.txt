If you're looking for a more concise and automatic way, you might consider using a simple formula directly in the JSON structure. However, it's crucial to strike a balance between simplicity and readability. Here's an example:

```json
{
  "inputs": ["wi0", "vector_dij"],
  "weights_and_biases": ["α", "β", "γ", "δ", "ε", "ζ", "η", "θ", "φ"],
  "activation_functions": ["dynamic_activation_function_based_on_complexity_wi0", 
                           "dynamic_activation_function_based_on_complexity_vector_dij", 
                           ...],
  "complexity_factor": "dynamic_complexity_factor",
  "settings_adjustment": {
    "activation_functions": {
      "wi0": "dynamic_activation_function_based_on_complexity_wi0",
      "vector_dij": "dynamic_activation_function_based_on_complexity_vector_dij"
    },
    "preprocessing": "dynamic_preprocessing_based_on_complexity",
    "ensemble_learning": "dynamic_ensemble_learning_based_on_complexity",
    "hyperparameter_tuning": "dynamic_hyperparameter_settings_based_on_complexity"
  },
  "training_loop": {
    "num_epochs": 10,
    "update_complexity_factor": "dynamic_complexity_factor *= 1.01"
  }
}
```

In this example:
- `"update_complexity_factor"` is a simple multiplication, which can be adjusted based on your desired rate of change.

While this makes the JSON structure more concise, it's important to ensure that the formula accurately reflects your intended behavior and is easy to understand for anyone working with the code. If the formula becomes more complex, it might be advisable to separate the logic into actual code for clarity and maintainability.
