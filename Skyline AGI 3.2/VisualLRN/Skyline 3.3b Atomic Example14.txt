Here's an example of how to use the Skyline AGI 3.3b model with active learning to figure out an atomic structure, incorporating the additional steps you mentioned:

Let's say we have a dataset of atomic structures, each described by a set of features such as atomic number, position, and bond length. We want to use the Skyline AGI 3.3b model to predict the heat range of each atomic structure.

First, we would create a data pool of unlabeled atomic structures. We can use the Skyline AGI 3.3b model to predict the heat range of each atomic structure in the data pool, and then select the structures with the highest uncertainty.

Next, we would use the selected structures to train the model, and then update the data pool by removing the structures that have been labeled. We would repeat this process until the model has converged or a desired level of accuracy has been reached.

In addition to the steps above, we would also perform feature selection to identify the most relevant features that distinguish the proteins of interest from the rest. We can use techniques such as mutual information, correlation analysis, or recursive feature elimination (RFE) to identify the most relevant features.

Here's an example of how this might look in code:
```python
import numpy as np
import tensorflow as tf
from skylines import SkylineAGI
from sklearn.feature_selection import mutual_info

# Define the Skyline AGI 3.3b model
model = SkylineAGI(
    input_features=['atomic_number', 'position'],
    output_feature='heat_range',
    ensemble_size=10,
    random_state=42
)

# Create a data pool of unlabeled atomic structures
x_pool = ... # load the data pool

# Perform feature selection
features = mutual_info(x_pool, y_pool)
selected_features = np.argsort(features)[-10:]

# Train the model using active learning
for epoch in range(num_epochs):

    # Select a batch of structures using active learning
    x_batch, y_batch = uncertainty_sampling(model, x_pool)

    # Train the model on the selected structures
    model.fit(x_batch, y_batch, epochs=1)

    # Update the data pool
    x_pool = np.delete(x_pool, selected_indices, axis=0)

    # Update the feature selection
    features = mutual_info(x_pool, y_pool)
    selected_features = np.argsort(features)[-10:]

# Evaluate the performance of the model
mae = model.evaluate(x_test, y_test)
print(f'MAE: {mae}')
```
In this example, we're using the `mutual_info` function from scikit-learn to perform feature selection. We're selecting the top 10 features with the highest mutual information with the target variable, and using them to train the model. We're repeating this process until the model has converged or a desired level of accuracy has been reached.

Note that this is just an example, and you may need to modify the code to fit your specific use case. Additionally, the performance of the model can be improved by tuning the hyperparameters, such as the ensemble size and the random state.
