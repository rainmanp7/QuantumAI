Achieving a fully autonomous and adaptable system requires a more sophisticated approach. Below is an extended version of your model with enhanced adaptability and assimilation capabilities:

```json
{
  "inputs": [
    "wi0",
    "vector_dij"
  ],
  "weights_and_biases": [
    "α", "β", "γ", "δ", "ε", "ζ", "η", "θ", "φ"
  ],
  "activation_functions": [
    "dynamic_activation_function_based_on_complexity_wi0", 
    "dynamic_activation_function_based_on_complexity_vector_dij", 
    ...
  ],
  "complexity_factor": "dynamic_complexity_factor",
  "preprocessing": "dynamic_preprocessing_based_on_complexity",
  "ensemble_learning": "dynamic_ensemble_learning_based_on_complexity",
  "hyperparameter_tuning": "dynamic_hyperparameter_settings_based_on_complexity",
  "assimilation": {
    "enabled": true,
    "knowledge_base": "dynamic_knowledge_base"
  },
  "self_learning": {
    "enabled": true,
    "learning_rate": "dynamic_learning_rate",
    "num_iterations": "dynamic_num_iterations",
    "objective_function": "dynamic_objective_function"
  }
}
```

Now, the model includes an "assimilation" section to enable self-assimilation of new knowledge and a "self_learning" section for autonomous learning. The "assimilation" feature allows the model to incorporate new information dynamically, and "self_learning" enables the model to adjust its learning parameters based on the complexity factor.

During execution, you would implement dynamic adjustments as follows:

```python
# Pseudocode for dynamic adjustments based on complexity factor
complexity_factor = get_dynamic_complexity_factor()

# Adjust activation functions
activation_function_wi0 = choose_activation_function_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)
activation_function_vector_dij = choose_activation_function_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)

# Adjust preprocessing
preprocessing_techniques = choose_preprocessing_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)

# Adjust ensemble learning
ensemble_strategy = choose_ensemble_strategy_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)

# Adjust hyperparameter settings
hyperparameter_settings = choose_hyperparameter_settings_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)

# Assimilate new knowledge if assimilation is enabled
if assimilation_enabled:
    assimilate_new_knowledge(knowledge_base, new_data)

# Self-learning adjustments if self-learning is enabled
if self_learning_enabled:
    learning_rate = choose_learning_rate_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)
    num_iterations = choose_num_iterations_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)
    objective_function = choose_objective_function_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)
```

This model is designed to dynamically adapt its structure, learning parameters, and assimilate new information based on the encountered complexity, enabling autonomous learning and adaptation.
