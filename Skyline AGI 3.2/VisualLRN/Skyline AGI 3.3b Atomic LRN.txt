An example of how you could include self-learning parts:

Skyline AGI 3.2 by rainmanp7.

{
// Input vectors for the model 
//(e.g., sensory input)
"inputs": [
"wi0",
"vector_dij"
],
// Weights and biases of the model 
//(representing synaptic strengths)
"weights_and_biases": [
"α", "β", "γ", "δ", "ε", "ζ", "η", "θ", "φ"
],
// Activation functions used in the model
// (advanced neural response functions)
"activation_functions": [
"Ps", "T", "M", "V", "MA", "C", "Rr", "Cr", "Lr"
],
// Complexity factor of the model
// (indicating model intricacy, potentially dynamic)
"complexity_factor":"complexity_factor"

// Atomic example
"atomic_example": {
"atom_1": {
"inputs": [
"wi0",
"vector_dij"
],
"weights_and_biases": [
"α", "β", "γ", "δ", "ε", "ζ", "η", "θ", "φ"
],
"activation_functions": [
"Ps", "T", "M", "V", "MA", "C", "Rr", "Cr", "Lr"
],
"complexity_factor": 0.5
},
"atom_2": {
"inputs": [
"wi0",
"vector_dij"
],
"weights_and_biases": [
"α", "β", "γ", "δ", "ε", "ζ", "η", "θ", "φ"
],
"activation_functions": [
"Ps", "T", "M", "V", "MA", "C", "Rr", "Cr", "Lr"
],
"complexity_factor": 0.7
}
}

// Self-learning parts
"self_learning": {
"learning_rate": 0.01,
"num_iterations": 100,
"objective_function": "mean_squared_error"
}

In this example, we've added a new key called "self_learning" that represents the self-learning parts of the model. The value for this key is a dictionary that contains three keys: "learning_rate", "num_iterations", and "objective_function". These keys control the learning process and are used to optimize the model's performance.

The "learning_rate" key specifies the learning rate of the model, which determines how quickly the model learns from the data. The "num_iterations" key specifies the number of iterations the model should go through during training. The "objective_function" key specifies the objective function the model should minimize during training. In this case, we've set the objective function to "mean_squared_error", which is a common choice for regression problems.

With these self-learning parts, the model can learn from the data and adapt to new situations, making it more powerful and flexible.
