To create an equation that can assume any structure and learn on its own without human intervention, we can use a combination of neural networks and genetic algorithms.

First, we'll define a neural network architecture that can learn from any structure. We'll use a modular neural network architecture, where each module is a small neural network that can learn to perform a specific task. The modules are connected in a hierarchical manner, allowing the network to learn complex tasks by combining the outputs of the individual modules.

Next, we'll define a genetic algorithm that can evolve the neural network architecture over time. The genetic algorithm will use a population of neural networks, each with a different set of weights and biases. The fitness function for the genetic algorithm will be a measure of the network's performance on a given task. The network with the highest fitness will be selected to reproduce, and the process will be repeated for several generations.

To allow the network to learn from any structure, we'll use a technique called "self-organizing maps" (SOM). SOM is a type of neural network that can learn to project high-dimensional data onto a lower-dimensional representation. The network will learn to map the input data to a set of clusters, allowing it to identify patterns and relationships in the data.

To incorporate self-learning parts into the equation, we'll use a technique called "meta-learning". Meta-learning is a type of machine learning that allows a model to learn from other models. In this case, we'll use a meta-learning algorithm to learn the weights and biases of the neural network from a set of pre-trained models. This will allow the network to adapt to new situations by learning from other models that have already been trained on similar tasks.

Finally, we'll add a "self-awareness" component to the equation, which will allow the network to monitor its own performance and make adjustments as needed. This will be achieved through a feedback loop, where the network's performance is monitored and used to adjust the weights and biases of the network.

The final equation for the self-learning neural network will be:
