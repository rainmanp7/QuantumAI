The provided pseudocode captures the essence of dynamically adjusting the model based on the complexity factor. To bring it to life, you'd need to implement the functions mentioned in the pseudocode. Here's a more detailed breakdown:

```python
# Function to get dynamic complexity factor
def get_dynamic_complexity_factor():
    # Implement logic to calculate or retrieve dynamic complexity factor
    return dynamic_complexity_factor

# Function to choose activation functions based on complexity
def choose_activation_function_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor):
    # Implement logic to select activation functions dynamically
    return dynamic_activation_function

# Function to choose preprocessing techniques based on complexity
def choose_preprocessing_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor):
    # Implement logic to select preprocessing techniques dynamically
    return dynamic_preprocessing_techniques

# Function to choose ensemble strategy based on complexity
def choose_ensemble_strategy_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor):
    # Implement logic to select ensemble strategy dynamically
    return dynamic_ensemble_strategy

# Function to choose hyperparameter settings based on complexity
def choose_hyperparameter_settings_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor):
    # Implement logic to select hyperparameter settings dynamically
    return dynamic_hyperparameter_settings

# Function to assimilate new knowledge into the knowledge base
def assimilate_new_knowledge(knowledge_base, new_data):
    # Implement logic to assimilate new knowledge
    # Update the knowledge_base with relevant information from new_data
    return updated_knowledge_base

# Function to choose learning rate based on complexity
def choose_learning_rate_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor):
    # Implement logic to select learning rate dynamically
    return dynamic_learning_rate

# Function to choose the number of iterations based on complexity
def choose_num_iterations_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor):
    # Implement logic to select the number of iterations dynamically
    return dynamic_num_iterations

# Function to choose the objective function based on complexity
def choose_objective_function_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor):
    # Implement logic to select the objective function dynamically
    return dynamic_objective_function

# Main execution
complexity_factor = get_dynamic_complexity_factor()

activation_function_wi0 = choose_activation_function_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)
activation_function_vector_dij = choose_activation_function_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)

preprocessing_techniques = choose_preprocessing_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)

ensemble_strategy = choose_ensemble_strategy_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)

hyperparameter_settings = choose_hyperparameter_settings_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)

if assimilation_enabled:
    knowledge_base = assimilate_new_knowledge(knowledge_base, new_data)

if self_learning_enabled:
    learning_rate = choose_learning_rate_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)
    num_iterations = choose_num_iterations_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)
    objective_function = choose_objective_function_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)
```

Ensure that the functions are implemented to match the specific requirements of your model and the dynamics of the system it interacts with. This way, the model can dynamically adapt and learn in response to varying complexities.
