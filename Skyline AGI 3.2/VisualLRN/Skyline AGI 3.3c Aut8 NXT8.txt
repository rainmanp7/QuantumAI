To adapt the provided model for figuring out planetary alignments and associated time frames, we'll tailor the components to suit astronomical data. Here's an adjusted version:

```json
{
  "inputs": [
    "planetary_positions",
    "alignment_events"
  ],
  "weights_and_biases": [
    "α", "β", "γ", "δ", "ε", "ζ", "η", "θ", "φ"
  ],
  "activation_functions": [
    "dynamic_activation_function_based_on_planetary_positions",
    "dynamic_activation_function_based_on_alignment_events",
    ...
  ],
  "complexity_factor": "dynamic_complexity_factor",
  "preprocessing": "dynamic_preprocessing_based_on_astronomical_data",
  "ensemble_learning": "dynamic_ensemble_learning_based_on_astronomical_data",
  "hyperparameter_tuning": "dynamic_hyperparameter_settings_based_on_astronomical_data",
  "assimilation": {
    "enabled": true,
    "knowledge_base": "dynamic_astronomical_knowledge_base"
  },
  "self_learning": {
    "enabled": true,
    "learning_rate": "dynamic_learning_rate",
    "num_iterations": "dynamic_num_iterations",
    "objective_function": "dynamic_objective_function"
  }
}
```

Now, let's adjust the pseudocode for dynamic adjustments considering astronomical data:

```python
# Pseudocode for dynamic adjustments based on astronomical data
planetary_positions = get_planetary_positions()  # Example function to fetch current planetary positions
alignment_events = get_alignment_events()  # Example function to fetch historical alignment events

# Adjust activation functions based on planetary positions and alignment events
activation_function_planetary_positions = choose_activation_function_based_on_planetary_positions(planetary_positions)
activation_function_alignment_events = choose_activation_function_based_on_alignment_events(alignment_events)

# Adjust preprocessing based on astronomical data
preprocessing_techniques = choose_preprocessing_based_on_astronomical_data(planetary_positions, alignment_events)

# Adjust ensemble learning based on astronomical data
ensemble_strategy = choose_ensemble_strategy_based_on_astronomical_data(planetary_positions, alignment_events)

# Adjust hyperparameter settings based on astronomical data
hyperparameter_settings = choose_hyperparameter_settings_based_on_astronomical_data(planetary_positions, alignment_events)

# Assimilate new astronomical knowledge if assimilation is enabled
if assimilation_enabled:
    assimilate_new_astronomical_knowledge(astronomical_knowledge_base, new_astronomical_data)

# Self-learning adjustments if self-learning is enabled
if self_learning_enabled:
    learning_rate = choose_learning_rate_based_on_astronomical_data(planetary_positions, alignment_events)
    num_iterations = choose_num_iterations_based_on_astronomical_data(planetary_positions, alignment_events)
    objective_function = choose_objective_function_based_on_astronomical_data(planetary_positions, alignment_events)
```

In this adjusted version, we've focused on astronomical-specific inputs, activation functions, preprocessing, and learning adjustments. Functions like `get_planetary_positions` and `get_alignment_events` would need to be implemented based on your data source and characteristics of the astronomical data you're analyzing. Additionally, the functions starting with `choose_` need to be implemented based on the specifics of your model and the requirements of the astronomical analysis.
