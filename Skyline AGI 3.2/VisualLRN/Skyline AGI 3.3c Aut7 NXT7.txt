To get star alignments in the context of genomics, you would typically use a bioinformatics tool like Bowtie or BWA for aligning sequences to a reference genome. The pseudocode provided earlier focuses on the adaptation of a machine learning model for genomic data analysis, but it doesn't explicitly cover the alignment process. Here's an extended example that includes a step for aligning gene sequences using a hypothetical alignment tool:

```python
# Additional import for alignment tool (hypothetical)
from bioinformatics_tools import align_sequences

# Function to get gene sequence
def get_gene_sequence():
    # Implement logic to fetch gene sequence, for example, from a genomics database or file
    return gene_sequence

# Function to get genetic variants
def get_genetic_variants():
    # Implement logic to fetch genetic variants, for example, from a genomics database or file
    return genetic_variants

# Function to perform sequence alignment
def align_gene_sequence(gene_sequence, reference_genome):
    # Hypothetical function to align gene sequence to a reference genome
    aligned_sequence = align_sequences(gene_sequence, reference_genome)
    return aligned_sequence

# Pseudocode for dynamic adjustments based on genomics data
gene_sequence = get_gene_sequence()
genetic_variants = get_genetic_variants()

# Perform sequence alignment
reference_genome = fetch_reference_genome()  # Hypothetical function to fetch the reference genome
aligned_sequence = align_gene_sequence(gene_sequence, reference_genome)

# Adjust activation functions based on gene sequence and genetic variants
activation_function_gene_sequence = choose_activation_function_based_on_gene_sequence(aligned_sequence)
activation_function_genetic_variants = choose_activation_function_based_on_genetic_variants(genetic_variants)

# Adjust preprocessing based on genomics data
preprocessing_techniques = choose_preprocessing_based_on_genomic_data(aligned_sequence, genetic_variants)

# Adjust ensemble learning based on genomics data
ensemble_strategy = choose_ensemble_strategy_based_on_genomic_data(aligned_sequence, genetic_variants)

# Adjust hyperparameter settings based on genomics data
hyperparameter_settings = choose_hyperparameter_settings_based_on_genomic_data(aligned_sequence, genetic_variants)

# Assimilate new genomic knowledge if assimilation is enabled
if assimilation_enabled:
    assimilate_new_genomic_knowledge(genomic_knowledge_base, new_genomic_data)

# Self-learning adjustments if self-learning is enabled
if self_learning_enabled:
    learning_rate = choose_learning_rate_based_on_genomic_data(aligned_sequence, genetic_variants)
    num_iterations = choose_num_iterations_based_on_genomic_data(aligned_sequence, genetic_variants)
    objective_function = choose_objective_function_based_on_genomic_data(aligned_sequence, genetic_variants)
```

This extended pseudocode includes a hypothetical function `align_gene_sequence` that represents the alignment step. In a real-world scenario, you would use a specific bioinformatics tool for this task. The `fetch_reference_genome` function is also hypothetical and would need to be implemented based on your reference genome source.

Extending this information we would consider the following information.

This is the extended example with some missing elements filled in, including a hypothetical alignment tool:

```python
# Additional import for alignment tool (hypothetical)
from bioinformatics_tools import align_sequences

# Function to get gene sequence
def get_gene_sequence():
    # Implement logic to fetch gene sequence, for example, from a genomics database or file
    return gene_sequence

# Function to get genetic variants
def get_genetic_variants():
    # Implement logic to fetch genetic variants, for example, from a genomics database or file
    return genetic_variants

# Function to perform sequence alignment
def align_gene_sequence(gene_sequence, reference_genome):
    # Hypothetical function to align gene sequence to a reference genome
    aligned_sequence = align_sequences(gene_sequence, reference_genome)
    return aligned_sequence

# Pseudocode for dynamic adjustments based on genomics data
gene_sequence = get_gene_sequence()
genetic_variants = get_genetic_variants()

# Hypothetical function to fetch the reference genome
def fetch_reference_genome():
    # Implement logic to fetch the reference genome
    return reference_genome

# Perform sequence alignment
reference_genome = fetch_reference_genome()
aligned_sequence = align_gene_sequence(gene_sequence, reference_genome)

# Adjust activation functions based on gene sequence and genetic variants
activation_function_gene_sequence = choose_activation_function_based_on_gene_sequence(aligned_sequence)
activation_function_genetic_variants = choose_activation_function_based_on_genetic_variants(genetic_variants)

# Adjust preprocessing based on genomics data
preprocessing_techniques = choose_preprocessing_based_on_genomic_data(aligned_sequence, genetic_variants)

# Adjust ensemble learning based on genomics data
ensemble_strategy = choose_ensemble_strategy_based_on_genomic_data(aligned_sequence, genetic_variants)

# Adjust hyperparameter settings based on genomics data
hyperparameter_settings = choose_hyperparameter_settings_based_on_genomic_data(aligned_sequence, genetic_variants)

# Assimilate new genomic knowledge if assimilation is enabled
if assimilation_enabled:
    assimilate_new_genomic_knowledge(genomic_knowledge_base, new_genomic_data)

# Self-learning adjustments if self-learning is enabled
if self_learning_enabled:
    learning_rate = choose_learning_rate_based_on_genomic_data(aligned_sequence, genetic_variants)
    num_iterations = choose_num_iterations_based_on_genomic_data(aligned_sequence, genetic_variants)
    objective_function = choose_objective_function_based_on_genomic_data(aligned_sequence, genetic_variants)
```

In this example, I've added a hypothetical function `fetch_reference_genome` to simulate fetching the reference genome. The `align_gene_sequence` function now represents the alignment step using a hypothetical tool (`align_sequences`). Please replace these hypothetical functions with actual implementations or bioinformatics tools based on your specific needs and available resources.
