Here is the information with the dynamic adjustments implemented in Python pseudocode:

```json
{
  "inputs": [
    "wi0",
    "vector_dij"
  ],
  "weights_and_biases": [
    "α", "β", "γ", "δ", "ε", "ζ", "η", "θ", "φ"
  ],
  "activation_functions": [
    "dynamic_activation_function_based_on_complexity_wi0", 
    "dynamic_activation_function_based_on_complexity_vector_dij", 
    ...
  ],
  "complexity_factor": "dynamic_complexity_factor",
  "preprocessing": "dynamic_preprocessing_based_on_complexity",
  "ensemble_learning": "dynamic_ensemble_learning_based_on_complexity",
  "hyperparameter_tuning": "dynamic_hyperparameter_settings_based_on_complexity",
  "assimilation": {
    "enabled": true,
    "knowledge_base": "dynamic_knowledge_base"
  },
  "self_learning": {
    "enabled": true,
    "learning_rate": "dynamic_learning_rate",
    "num_iterations": "dynamic_num_iterations",
    "objective_function": "dynamic_objective_function"
  },
  "dynamic_adaptation": {
    "enabled": true,
    "adaptation_rate": "dynamic_adaptation_rate",
    "adaptation_range": "dynamic_adaptation_range"
  },
  "learning_strategies": [
    {
      "name": "incremental_learning",
      "enabled": true,
      "learning_rate": "dynamic_learning_rate",
      "num_iterations": "dynamic_num_iterations"
    },
    {
      "name": "batch_learning",
      "enabled": true,
      "learning_rate": "dynamic_learning_rate",
      "num_iterations": "dynamic_num_iterations"
    }
  ]
}
```

In this extended model, a new section called "dynamic_adaptation" enables the model to adapt its structure and learning parameters dynamically based on the encountered complexity. Additionally, the "learning_strategies" section allows the model to use different learning strategies, such as incremental learning and batch learning, based on the complexity factor.

During execution, dynamic adjustments are implemented as follows:

```python
import concurrent.futures
import threading
import functools

# Locks for thread safety
activation_lock = threading.Lock()
preprocessing_lock = threading.Lock()
ensemble_lock = threading.Lock()
hyperparameter_lock = threading.Lock()
knowledge_lock = threading.Lock()

# Memoization decorator
@functools.lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def get_complexity_factor(input_data):
    # Your complexity factor calculation logic here
    # ...
    return complexity_factor

# Function to parallelize learning strategy adjustments
def adjust_learning_strategy(learning_strategy, lock):
    with lock:
        # Your learning strategy adjustment logic here
        # ...

# Function to parallelize dynamic adaptation adjustments
def adjust_dynamic_adaptation(lock):
    with lock:
        # Your dynamic adaptation adjustment logic here
        # ...

# Get the complexity factor directly from your complexity calculation logic
complexity_factor = get_complexity_factor(input_data)

# Adjust activation functions
with activation_lock:
    activation_function_wi0 = choose_activation_function_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)
    activation_function_vector_dij = choose_activation_function_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)

# Adjust preprocessing techniques
with preprocessing_lock:
    preprocessing_techniques = choose_preprocessing_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)

# Adjust ensemble learning strategy
with ensemble_lock:
    ensemble_strategy = choose_ensemble_strategy_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)

# Adjust hyperparameter settings
with hyperparameter_lock:
    hyperparameter_settings = choose_hyperparameter_settings_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)

# Assimilate new knowledge if assimilation is enabled
if assimilation_enabled:
    with knowledge_lock:
        assimilate_new_knowledge(knowledge_base, new_data)

# Self-learning adjustments if self-learning is enabled
if self_learning_enabled:
    learning_rate = choose_learning_rate_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)
    num_iterations = choose_num_iterations_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)
    objective_function = choose_objective_function_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)

    # Parallelize learning strategy adjustments
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        executor.map(lambda strategy: adjust_learning_strategy(strategy, knowledge_lock), learning_strategies)

# Dynamic adaptation adjustments if dynamic adaptation is enabled
if dynamic_adaptation_enabled:
    adaptation_rate = choose_adaptation_rate_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)
    adaptation_range = choose_adaptation_range_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)

    # Parallelize dynamic adaptation adjustments
    with concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        executor.submit(lambda: adjust_dynamic_adaptation(knowledge_lock))
```

This approach enhances the model's adaptability and learning efficiency by responding dynamically to the complexity of encountered data.
