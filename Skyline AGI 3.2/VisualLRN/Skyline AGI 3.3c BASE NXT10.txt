In this extended model, we have added a new section called "dynamic_adaptation" that enables the model to adapt its structure and learning parameters dynamically based on the encountered complexity. We have also added a new section called "learning_strategies" that allows the model to use different learning strategies, such as incremental learning and batch learning, based on the complexity factor.

During execution, you would implement dynamic adjustments as follows:

```python
# Pseudocode for dynamic adjustments based on complexity factor
complexity_factor = get_dynamic_complexity_factor()

# Adjust activation functions
activation_function_wi0 = choose_activation_function_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)
activation_function_vector_dij = choose_activation_function_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)

# Adjust preprocessing
preprocessing_techniques = choose_preprocessing_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)

# Adjust ensemble learning
ensemble_strategy = choose_ensemble_strategy_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)

# Adjust hyperparameter settings
hyperparameter_settings = choose_hyperparameter_settings_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)

# Assimilate new knowledge if assimilation is enabled
if assimilation_enabled:
    assimilate_new_knowledge(knowledge_base, new_data)

# Self-learning adjustments if self-learning is enabled
if self_learning_enabled:
    learning_rate = choose_learning_rate_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)
    num_iterations = choose_num_iterations_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)
    objective_function = choose_objective_function_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)

# Dynamic adaptation adjustments if dynamic adaptation is enabled
if dynamic_adaptation_enabled:
    adaptation_rate = choose_adaptation_rate_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)
    adaptation_range = choose_adaptation_range_based_on_complexity(complexity_factor)
    adapt_model_structure(adaptation_rate, adaptation
