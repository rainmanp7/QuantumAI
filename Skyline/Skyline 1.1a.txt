wi = (wi0 / (1 + (vector_dij / τ))) * (1 + α * Ps + β * T + γ * M + δ * V + ε * MA + ζ * C + η * S + θ * Si + φ * Td_i + _cache[(wi0, dij, τ, learning_method_coefficients, complexity_factor, object_properties, position_relative_to_center)] + complexity_factor * (multithreaded_vector_pipeline(vector_data, T1, T2, ...) | pipeline | multithreaded_pipeline(vector_calculations, T1, T2, ...)))

Where: - _cache[(wi0, dij, τ, learning_method_coefficients, complexity_factor, object_properties, position_relative_to_center)]:

This represents the cached weight update value for specific input parameters. If the calculation has been done before with the same input parameters, this cached value is used directly, avoiding redundant calculations.
